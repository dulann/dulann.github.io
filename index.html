                     Dr. Lan Du is a lecturer (equivalent to assistant professor) at Monash University, and affiliated with the machine learning group in Centre of Data Science. He is a Teaching and Research Academic (a core faculty member) in the Faculty of IT, Monash Clayton Campus. He is also a deputy course director of master of data sceince degree at Monash.</p>

            			<h2>Research Interests       			     </h2>
           			 <ul>
				   <li><b>Topic modelling</b>: 
				   	He is interested in developing advanced topic models that
				   	can take into account diverse information or features exhibited by free language text,
				   	for example,  various linguistic feature 
				   	(either semantic or syntactic),  temporal 
				   	information,  labels, word embeddings, etc.</li>
                                   <li><b>Non-parametric Bayesian methods</b>:
                                  	He has broad interests in the study of nonparametric Bayesian
                                  	methods, e.g., Pitman-Yor process, Indian Buffet process, Gamma process, etc. 
                   	   </li>
				   <li><b>Probsblistic Tensor factorization</b> for social network analysis, relation extraction and relational learning. He is particuarly interested in building various auxiliary information into the factorization process.</li>
			  	 <li> <b>Statistical ranking models</b>:
				   	Label ranking is an important task in, for example, preference learning. 
					The existing ranking methods include but not limited to the pair-wised ranking models, distance based ranking models
				   	and multistage ranking models. However, if the number of items to be ranked is countably infinite, it is unfeasible 
				   	for each ranker to rank all the items. He is interested in both partial ranking models and infinite ranking models, 
				   	and applying them to, for example, topic segmentation. 
				   </li>
				</ul>
